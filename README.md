## Table of Contents



## UX
### Project Goals

Goal of this project is to provide relaxing entertament for a user. Nice to look warm design combined with classic card game.

### User stories

As a customer I expect:

- simply navigation
- easy to read and functional content
- the feeling of using a premium product

As a developer I expect:
- easy to read code
- hassle-free implementation of new features
- simple adding of new content at the request of the owner

### Design choices

#### Colors

Contrasting theme idea - street lamps illuminate the night.

#### Typography

Exo, NTR - modern-looking fonts well reflecting the spirit of the content. A pairing recommendation is given by https://fontjoy.com/

#### Images

The selected images are supposed to affect the imagination and give the feeling of high speed, great power, and beauty of cult cars.

#### Animations and Transitions

I didn't want to overwhelm the user with too many animation effects. In my opinion, it's very easy to distract a user from the main content by adding animations everywhere and finally it ends as a bad user experience. See below the effects I used:

- The current page is marked by underline

  ![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114284732/195984465-5da4950d-d984-4c7b-b743-27f341f66b1f.png)

- Hovering over the hyperlink element changes its color to yellow

- simply animation is added to social media icons

## Accessibility

Accessibility testing is aimed to make sure that those with visual or physical disabilities can still browse your website. Some users have had strokes or accidents that make it difficult to use a mouse so they use keyboard keys to tab through sites. Others use screen readers that rely on HTML tags to help the user navigate quickly through the site to find the information they want, others have color blindness or contrast issues. It's the law to provide services 
Here's a [site](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#:~:text=Accessibility%20is%20Important%20for%20Individuals%2C%20Businesses%2C%20Society,-The%20Web%20is&text=That%20is%2C%20the%20accessibility%20barriers,older%20people) where we can learn more about accessibility and the internet.
Engine Boos Garage site is designed to support users with reading difficulties.
